# OpenMeteo-UI
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my project, I propose that I build a weather app.  This weather app will interface with the OpenMeteo API.  When the user opens the app, they will be greeted with a homepage.  This homepage will contain several different granularities of weather forecasts (today, weekly, next two weeks, etc.). The main purpose of this weppage is to make it easy to find weather reports that are accurate  for the user's location.  To make it easier, the site could even use the browser's built-in location api.  
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel like this weather app is needed because all of the modern weather apps are extremely cluttered.  Their user interfaced can sometimes take upwards of 30 seconds to load all of the elements (usually including ads).  This application should allow me to see exactly the weather data I want, when I want it.  Overall, I need a weather app that can display weather for a few different saved locations, get the current location from a browser api, and display it in a chosen granularity.  At any given time, there should not be a distracting amount of data on the screen.  The website should be sleek, modern, and streamlined.  
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the summer, I am often working outside, and it would be nice to be able to check the weather to see how hot it will get.  If possible, it would also be nice to get a UV index, so that I know how much sunblock I need to put on, or if I need to wear a het.  This project will fill a real functional need for me, and possibly others who are looking for a more streamlined weather experience.  
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also going to implement either a location picker or a list of favorite locations.
