# OpenMeteo-UI
For my project, I propose that I build a weather app.  This weather app will interface with the OpenMeteo API.  When the user opens the app, they will be greeted with a homepage.  This homepage will contain several different granularities of weather forecasts (today, weekly, next two weeks, historical data, etc.). The main purpose of this weppage is to make it easy to find weather reports that are accurate  for the user's location.  To make it easier, the site could even use the browser's built-in location api.  

## April 6 - Week 1
- [ ] Create base html on the homepage with form, images, figures, list, etc.
- [ ] Create css flex layout with transitions, color, margin, padding, etc.

## April 13 - Week 2
- [ ] Get service section working to get weather data using JS. 
- [ ] Get at least one forecast granularity working.
- [ ] Be able to render a forecast using JS.
- [ ] Save weather data to local storage (to avoid redundant requests). 

## April 20 - Week 3
- [ ] use drag-and drop in a location picker (maybe)
- [ ] polish up the look and feel of the website
- [ ] upload website to static host

## April 27 - Last day of class and due date for final project
- [ ] Turn in the finished project
